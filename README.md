# Eisenlower PM

## Introduction
Eisenlower PM is a project management tool based on the Eisenhower Quadrant:
  1. Important & Urgent,
  2. Important,
  3. Urgent,
  4. Neither Important nor Urgent

While Eisenhower Matrix provides guidance in work priorization, it falls short in terms of work delivery. Someone who's constantly working on long-term projects may look unproductive, especially in remote working settings. This is why users should be able to see the **lower** hanging fruits and complete those tasks that are near-completion. This is the core principle of Simple PM
